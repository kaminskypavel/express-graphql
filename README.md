===

lets explore how to build a graphql based api and its many tools and options, batteries and security are included.

most of the example are base on [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) ,but we will also play with [Grapql-Yoga](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-yoga) and others

- `01-basic` - just a basic apollo & express integration to "get it going" ðŸš€

- `02-graphql-code-generator` - a neat tool to generate usefull types and methods for a given gql endpoint. for this example we usd the (https://countries.trevorblades.com) endpoint to generate the content of `src/types.d.ts`
